## **1.5-Month WBS for Speech Accessibility App**

### **Week 1: Project Initiation & Setup**
- **Project Kickoff & Planning**
  - Define MVP scope and user stories.
  - Outline architecture and integration points (React Native frontend, FastAPI backend, Hugging Face models).
- **Environment Setup**
  - Initialize Git repository and CI/CD pipeline.
  - Set up development environments for FastAPI (Python) and React Native.
- **Initial Project Scaffolding**
  - Create basic FastAPI project structure with initial endpoints.
  - Create basic React Native project with navigation and a placeholder home screen.

### **Week 2: Backend Core & AI Model Integration**
- **FastAPI Backend Development**
  - Develop key REST endpoints (authentication, speech input processing, predictive text).
  - Set up database connection and schema (MySQL).
- **Hugging Face Integration**
  - Integrate Hugging Face API for speech-to-text (Whisper) and predictive text (BERT).
  - Create API endpoints for processing audio inputs and text predictions.
- **Testing & Documentation**
  - Write initial tests for backend endpoints.
  - Document API specifications.

### **Week 3: Frontend â€“ Speech Recognition & Basic UI**
- **React Native UI Development**
  - Build main screens: Home, Speech Input, Manual Word Selection.
  - Implement basic user authentication UI.
- **Speech Recognition Integration**
  - Integrate React Native Voice for real-time speech input.
  - Connect UI to FastAPI endpoint for speech recognition.
- **Initial Integration Testing**
  - Validate end-to-end flow for speech input and text conversion.

### **Week 4: AI Middleware Enhancement & Manual Input Features**
- **AI Middleware & Contextual Predictions**
  - Refine Hugging Face integration to include contextual predictions.
  - Implement user-specific learning algorithms (store preferences, feedback loops).
- **Manual Word Selection Feature**
  - Develop UI components for manual word selection.
  - Connect manual selection to predictive text API for context suggestions.
- **Mid-Sprint Review**
  - Gather internal feedback and iterate on UI/UX and API responses.

### **Week 5: TTS Integration & System Refinement**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Implementation**
  - Integrate Smart TTS engine (e.g., Google TTS/ElevenLabs) in the backend.
  - Implement frontend functionality to play generated audio.
- **System Optimization**
  - Enhance latency and error handling across API calls.
  - Optimize speech normalization algorithms.
- **Integration Testing**
  - Conduct thorough integration tests across speech input, prediction, and TTS output.

### **Week 6: Final Testing, QA & Deployment Preparations**
- **Final Testing & Bug Fixes**
  - Perform full end-to-end QA testing.
  - Resolve bugs and refine UI/UX based on testing feedback.
- **Deployment Preparation**
  - Prepare FastAPI and React Native deployment pipelines.
  - Finalize documentation and user guides.
- **Sprint Review & Handoff**
  - Conduct a final sprint review meeting.
  - Gather feedback and outline post-deployment enhancements.
