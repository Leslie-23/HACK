### **Speech Accessibility App Outline for AI-Driven Speech Accessibility Mobile App**

---

## **1. Project Overview**

- **Goal:** Develop a mobile app to enhance speech accessibility using AI-driven speech-to-text (STT) and predictive text capabilities.
- **Target Users:** Individuals with speech impairments or accessibility needs.
- **Core Features:**
  - Real-time speech recognition (STT)
  - Predictive text suggestions
  - Text-to-speech (TTS) conversion
  - Cloud-based AI model inference

---

## **2. Technology Stack Selection**

### **Frontend (Mobile App)**

- **Framework:** React Native
- **UI Library:** React Native Paper / NativeBase / TailwindCSS for styling
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit / Zustand
- **Navigation:** React Navigation
- **Networking:** Axios / Fetch API
- **Speech Handling:** React Native Voice for STT, Custom Whisper/Vosk integration
- **Testing:** Jest & React Native Testing Library

### **Backend**

- **Choice:** **FastAPI vs. Node.js**

  - **FastAPI (Recommended)**
    - Faster execution for AI-related tasks (Python-based)
    - Best for integrating Whisper/Vosk & ML models
    - Async support like Node.js
  - **Node.js (Alternative)**
    - Good for handling concurrent requests
    - Works well with REST/GraphQL APIs
    - Extra work needed to integrate AI models (Python required for ML)

  **Verdict:** **FastAPI is better suited for ML tasks due to Python integration and Hugging Face support.**

- **Database:** MySQL (MariaDB as an alternative)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (FastAPI) or Prisma (Node.js)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication

### **Speech-to-Text (STT) Engine**

- **Whisper (Recommended)**
  - Developed by OpenAI
  - Higher accuracy for diverse accents & noisy environments
  - Requires more computation power
- **Vosk (Alternative)**

  - Lightweight, works offline
  - Lower hardware requirements, but slightly less accurate

  **Verdict:** **Whisper is better for cloud-based deployment; Vosk is ideal for offline use.**

### **Predictive Text Model**

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
  - Best for contextual text prediction
  - Lightweight and efficient
- **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)**

  - More flexible and powerful
  - Works better for sentence completions rather than word suggestions

  **Verdict:** **BERT is better suited for predictive text, as it focuses on word-level context prediction.**

### **Cloud Hosting & AI Model Deployment**

- **Hugging Face (Inference API)**
  - Model hosting for STT & predictive text
  - Integrates with FastAPI easily
- **Alternatives:**

  - AWS Lambda for serverless inference
  - Google Cloud AI for optimized AI services

  **Verdict:** **Hugging Face is a great choice for AI hosting, with easy integration.**
