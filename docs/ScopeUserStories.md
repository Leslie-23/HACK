### **MVP Scope & User Stories for Speech Accessibility App**  

---

## **📌 MVP Scope**  

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for the **Speech Accessibility App** will focus on delivering the **core functionality** that enables users with speech impairments to communicate effectively using AI-powered speech-to-text (STT), predictive text, and text-to-speech (TTS).  

### **🔹 Core Features for MVP**  

1. **Speech Input & Recognition**  
   - Users can speak into the app, and the system transcribes their speech using AI-driven **Whisper (STT)**.  
   - The app processes speech normalization for better accuracy.  

2. **Manual Word Selection (Alternative Input)**  
   - Users who cannot speak can select words/phrases manually.  
   - Predictive text assists in quickly forming sentences.  

3. **Predictive Text Suggestions**  
   - AI (BERT) suggests words or phrases based on context.  
   - Users can select from a dynamic list of suggestions.  

4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Output**  
   - Users can convert text (typed or recognized from speech) into speech using **Smart TTS**.  
   - Voice output mimics user’s vocal identity over time.  

5. **User-Specific Learning & Adaptation**  
   - AI learns from past interactions and improves predictions.  
   - Customization of frequently used words, phrases, and speaking style.  

6. **Basic User Authentication**  
   - Sign-up/Login via **JWT authentication**.  
   - Users can save preferences and personalize AI responses.  

7. **Basic UI & Accessibility Features**  
   - Simple and intuitive UI using **React Native**.  
   - Large buttons, high-contrast text, and voice-based navigation for accessibility.
